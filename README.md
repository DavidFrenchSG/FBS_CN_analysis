# FBS_CN_analysis

This project contains the code necessary for producing the experimental statistics publication with the environmental data.

Running the CN_analysis_build.R programme should create an Excel workbook containing the data for publication.

The environmental data open dataset is also created at the same time. This gets uploaded to statistics.gov.scot: https://statistics.gov.scot/resource?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fstatistics.gov.scot%2Fdata%2Ffarm-business-survey-farm-level-emissions-and-nitrogen-usage
