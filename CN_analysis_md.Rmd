# Summary

These new and experimental data provide greenhouse gas emission estimates and nitrogen use estimates for the average Scottish farm over the last three years. These data complement national-level estimates and enterprise-specific estimates by providing a view and time series of emissions and nitrogen use on real farms. 

This analysis is based on a survey of around 400 commercial farms. Data do not cover the full agricultural industry and are not comparable with national estimates.

Absolute gross greenhouse gas emissions per hectare and per unit of product are estimated using a carbon calculator.

Nitrogen estimates are based on standard estimates of nitrogen content in all farm inputs and outputs, where possible. 

Nitrogen balance estimates the amount of nitrogen that might be lost to the environment.

Estimates of nitrogen use efficiency, the ratio of nitrogen outputs to inputs, vary by farm output type. Arable farms typically have higher nitrogen use efficiency estimates than livestock farms.

The [full publication on gov.scot](`r publication_url`) contains additional commentary. All data tables are available to download in the associated [supporting documents](`r documents_url`).
